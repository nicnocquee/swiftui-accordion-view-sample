# About

This is a sample of an accordion view written in SwiftUI for [swiftid.dev challenge 1](https://github.com/nicnocquee/swiftid-dev-challenge-1).

# Prerequisite

This app fetches a random joke from [official joke API](https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api). But since the server is not running anymore, we can just run the server locally.

- Clone the [official joke api](https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api).
- Then run `npm i && npm run dev`
